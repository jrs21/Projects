## This program contains a binary classifier utilizing the logistic regression. The purpose of this classifier is to predict the CVD risk on a group of patients with regards to other potential factors that may affect their risk. This is taken into consideration with a list ranking in order of CVD risk that those features/factors may pose on the patients in this study. Finally the overall performance of the classifier is examined with an AUC and F1 score followed by a ROC curve.
